# Ozone

## The simplest AQI API!

I want to make it easy to get your hands on accurate air quality data for your project, whatever it is. Ozone makes this as straightforward as typing out a few lines of code. Ozone uses the World Air Quality Index's API to fetch data, so you can trust the data you get to be accurate and reliable.

## Getting your API token - IMPORTANT

To use Ozone, you must first request and get a your own unique API token. This is required to access for the underlying API to work.

This is very easy to do, and takes no time at all as your token is generally emailed to you instantly.

Get your token [here](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/)!

## World Air Quality Index and EPA attribution

This package is a wrapper around an API provided by the World Air Quality Index project. Without them as well as the US EPA, Ozone would not exist. Please consider visiting the WAQI website and contributing to their project if you have time:
